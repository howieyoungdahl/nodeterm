# Shared Codex node identity — the account-scoped ownership spine

A Codex canvas node talks to **one shared `codex app-server`** and owns **one thread** inside it.
The node↔thread mapping is what survives resumes, in-pane restarts, and app restarts. S6 adds the
**account** dimension: the same machine can hold the system login (`~/.codex`) alongside several
managed logins, and a thread's ownership record must name **which account** it belongs to, not just
which node — so one account can never be made to speak for another's threads.

This document covers the whole S6 feature — the account × machine model, the on-disk layout, the
switch and cross-machine protocols, the fail-closed properties, and the same-filesystem (U3) /
discovery (U1) constraints the probes settled. S6 shipped across nine PRs (the account model, the
identity proxy documented here, the rollout primitive, the relay daemon, local accounts + the switch,
SSH remote accounts, per-account usage, the Settings UI, and the per-node account picker); this
feature is **fully operable** — a Codex node carries an account scope, the picker stamps it, and the
switch/transfer verbs run. Every layer is tested against real primitives (real `/bin/sh`, real fs,
real HMAC, the real main-side switch handler); the composition is walked once end-to-end in
`src/main/codex-accounts-e2e.test.ts` (Task 9.2), and the human/device verifications that headless CI
cannot run are enumerated in [the acceptance gate](codex-accounts-acceptance.md).

Based on @Corvin's S6 design in external PR #112.

## The account × machine model

An account is **system** or **managed**, and it lives on **one machine**:

- **System account** — the login at `$CODEX_HOME` (or `~/.codex`). No id. Always resolves. A machine
  with no managed accounts behaves exactly as it did before S6 (Constraint 12).
- **Managed account** — a second (or third…) logged-in Codex identity, addressed by a validated id.
  Its home is private (`0700`) and isolated; only NON-secret installation assets (`config.toml`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `skills`, …) are symlinked in from the system home — never `auth.json`, never the
  thread DB, so a managed account acts only as **its own** login.
- **Remote account** — the same, but its home lives on an SSH host (`host` set). The desktop drives
  its lifecycle over SSH; the host runs the relay + import, not its own account-management IPC.

`id` empty/undefined at any call site means the system account. Ids arrive from hand-editable,
git-shared `settings.json` / `project.json`, so every id passes `isSafeAccountId`
(`^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$`, must start alphanumeric) **before** it becomes a path component.

## On-disk home layout

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| System home | `$CODEX_HOME` or `~/.codex` |
| Managed home (local) | `~/.nodeterm/cx/<sha256(userDataDir ␀ accountId)[0..16]>`, mode `0700` |
| Managed home (remote) | `<remoteHome>/.nodeterm/cx/<sha256(accountId)[0..16]>` |
| App-server control socket | `<home>/app-server-control/app-server-control.sock` |
| Ownership records | `<userDataDir>/codex-thread-nodes/` (system: bare root; managed: `<accountId>/`) |

The digest is deliberately **short**: the app-server control Unix socket lives two levels below the
home and must stay under macOS `SUN_LEN`, which an Electron userData path plus a UUID already
overshoots. `userDataDir` is folded into the LOCAL digest so separate NodeTerm profiles never
collide; a remote host has one home root, so the remote digest is over `accountId` only. A
pre-migration long home (`<userData>/codex-accounts/<id>`) is moved to its short home at boot,
fail-closed (no-op if absent, if the target exists, or on an invalid id).

## Shared-daemon restart continuity

The control socket is not one process per canvas node. Every `codex --remote unix://` TUI for an
account scope rides one persistent app-server, so an app-server upgrade, repair, or crash severs all
of them at once. Their tmux panes and Codex rollouts remain intact, but without a client supervisor
each pane drops back to its shell and looks like a reset.

The generated launcher therefore owns the remote client for the lifetime of the bound thread:

1. It records the app-server control socket's inode before launching the TUI.
2. A normal exit or terminal signal returns unchanged.
3. After any other exit, it retries only when `codex app-server daemon version` does not report
   `status: running`, or when a known pre-launch socket inode changed. A failed inode read alone is
   unknown, not proof of a reset; an unrelated Codex failure against the same healthy generation
   returns its original status.
4. It starts a missing daemon through the same scrubbed environment used at preflight, then resumes
   the exact already-bound thread. Only the first launch receives the caller's prompt/options;
   recovery never replays them because that could submit the same user turn twice.
5. Three rapid resets stop the loop and print the exact manual `codex resume <thread>` command.

Protocol health is checked before lifecycle start. Codex's PID ownership record can become stale
while the socket remains responsive; that bookkeeping failure must not trigger a kill of live,
shared infrastructure. The behavior is failure-injection tested under real `/bin/sh` in
`src/core/codex-launcher-sh.test.ts`, including a mutation guard proving that a healthy
same-generation client error is not relaunched.

Desktop and Server Edition both wire this same core spine. The headless shell arms the
restart-stable record secret, registers thread start/bind handlers against its persisted canvas,
refreshes the launcher capability, and broadcasts identity mode through its normal browser RPC.
Mobile needs no separate implementation: it attaches to the Server Edition's existing tmux
session. Managed Codex account administration remains desktop-only; that is separate from
supervising the system account's shared app-server on the server host.

## The signing secret (both shells — Decision 1)

Every ownership record is HMAC-signed by the **one** restart-stable 32-byte node-auth secret
(`src/core/agents/node-auth-secret.ts`, `loadOrCreateNodeAuthSecret`). That secret already arms on
**both** shells and this proxy reuses it as-is:

- **Desktop:** sealed at rest via `safeStorage` → `node-auth-key.json` (ciphertext only, mode
  `0600`; no raw-secret fallback ever written).
- **Server Edition (no keychain):** 32 raw bytes at `node-auth-key.bin`, mode `0600`.

It is **confidential and fail-closed**: a malformed/wrong-length persisted state **throws** rather
than minting a fresh secret — rotating the key would orphan every bound thread on the machine — and
the single-flight cache clears on rejection so a healed machine retries. It is wired at boot in both
`src/main/index.ts` and `src/server/index.ts` via `setCodexThreadIdentityAuthSecret(...)`.

> No `safeStorage`-only secret module is introduced. @Corvin's `codex-node-auth-secret.ts` in
> PR #112 is `safeStorage`-ciphertext-only and throws on a headless server; the merged both-shells
> channel above is the correct mirror, and duplicating it as a keychain-only file would regress the
> Server Edition. This is the ratified Decision 1.

## The ownership records

`~/.nodeterm/codex-thread-nodes/` (under `CorePlatform.userDataDir`, **not** `~`):

- **System account** → the bare-root file `<root>/<threadId>` — the exact S4 layout, so a machine
  with no managed accounts is byte-for-byte unchanged and its legacy records keep resolving.
- **Managed account** → `<root>/<accountId>/<threadId>`.

Each record is a flat `key=value` text file, mode `0600`, **parsed as data, never sourced**:

```
accountId=<id or empty for system>
nodeId=<owning canvas node>
endpoint=<hook endpoint file path>
signature=<base64url HMAC>
```

### The signature binds the full 4-tuple

```
signature = base64url( HMAC-SHA256( key, threadId ␀ accountScope ␀ nodeId ␀ hookEndpoint ) )
```

`accountScope` is the account id, or the literal `system` for the system account (empty id
normalised). Because the scope is inside the preimage, a record signed for account **A** verifies
only under scope **A** — copying it byte-for-byte into account **B**'s directory fails the MAC.
Verification is `timingSafeEqual`. Records written before this slice carry **no** `accountId=` line
and are verified with the original 3-tuple preimage **at the system scope only** — the one
back-compat door, and it is a system-scope door (a scope-less signature is never honoured under a
managed account).

## Fail-closed ambiguity (the house rule, reused)

Ownership resolution reuses the merged fail-closed posture (`pane-ownership.ts`,
`node-identity-policy.ts`): **an owner that cannot be proven is denied.**

- `resolveCodexThreadNodeIdentity(threadId)` with no account hint (the shared tool shell that knows
  only a bare thread id) scans **every** scope and returns an owner **only when `owners.size === 1`**.
  The same thread id owned by two different accounts resolves to **nothing**.
- `resolveCodexThreadNodeIdentity(threadId, root, accountId)` with an explicit account resolves
  within that one scope.
- `codexThreadIdentityHasLiveConflict(...)` reports a conflict only when **two different live
  nodes** own the thread across scopes.

## The POSIX-sh resolver

`codexThreadIdentityResolverSh(root)` runs before either local command's environment gate;
`buildManagedScript` passes the additional `'hook'` caller mode before its own node gate. A tool
shell carries `CODEX_THREAD_ID`, but a reused app-server can supply absent, incomplete **or complete
foreign** `NODETERM_*`. Launch-time environment scrubbing cannot repair an already running daemon.
The resolver therefore always evaluates the exact thread/account binding when a thread id is
present. Without a thread id, all consumers retain their existing non-Codex behavior.

The launch contracts are `HookServer.buildPtyEnv` (`src/core/agents/hook-server.ts`) and
`codexSessionEnv`/`resolveCodexSessionScope` (`src/core/codex-accounts-core.ts`). Complete ambient
context means a safe node id, a shape-valid absolute endpoint path, and **any nonempty** client
`NODETERM_CANVAS_CONTROL` (including `0`, which the existing command gate treats as enabled).
`NODETERM_AGENT_ID` is optional metadata, and `NODETERM_SERVER_CANVAS_CONTROL` is a separate server
setting. Neither supplies identity or substitutes for the client capability. Endpoint readability
and token validity are not inferred from completeness; the existing consumers/server still check
those boundaries.

| Exact lookup result | Ambient context | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One shape/scope-valid binding | Empty or incomplete | Recover node, endpoint, Codex role and client capability |
| One shape/scope-valid binding | Complete, same node and endpoint | Accept and reload transport from that endpoint |
| One shape/scope-valid binding | Complete, different node or endpoint | Refuse `complete-context-conflict` before transport |
| No record exists in the selected scope(s) | Complete | Preserve direct in-process `codex exec` context unchanged |
| No record exists in the selected scope(s) | Empty or incomplete | Refuse `missing-binding` |
| Existing malformed/unreadable evidence or multiple bindings | Any | Refuse by name; never retain ambient authority |

Node and endpoint comparisons are byte-for-byte. The endpoint string is part of the signed
preimage: neither symlink resolution nor normalization of `/./`, trailing separators or aliases
hides a disagreement. Recovery, including the matching complete case, clears inherited socket,
port, hook token/version, node-token directory and legacy Codex node-token fields before the
consumer sources the selected endpoint. Otherwise an inherited socket can override the recovered
endpoint's port. It also replaces stale agent-role metadata with `codex`. A complete no-record
direct launch keeps its original transport and optional metadata.

`NODETERM_CODEX_ACCOUNT_ID` distinguishes three cases. **Unset** means unknown: inspect the bare
system record and each safe managed scope, requiring exactly one valid candidate and no invalid or
unreadable candidate evidence. **Explicitly empty** means system only, matching the launcher's
deliberate empty export that clears an inherited managed account. A **safe nonempty managed id**
restricts lookup to that directory. The literal `system` is reserved and refused as an environment
account id; a bare-root record may use `accountId=` empty, `accountId=system`, or the legacy omitted
line. Managed record account lines must agree with their directory. A missing record in an explicit
scope never borrows another scope's record; the supplied account hint is not rewritten on recovery.

Records are parsed as data with `awk`, never sourced. Node/endpoint/signature fields must each
occur once, account at most once; unknown or duplicate fields, unsafe field shapes, nonregular or
symlinked record files, unreadable records/directories and scope disagreements refuse by name.
Legacy records without an account line remain supported in the system scope. These are protected
record **shape/scope checks, not HMAC verification**: the shell has no signing key. Server identity,
per-node-token validation and child-ownership authorization remain authoritative and unchanged.

Refusals print only `Nodeterm Codex identity refused: <fixed-reason>.` to stderr. Commands exit 1.
Hooks drain stdin to EOF, print nothing to stdout and exit 0, preserving the telemetry contract
without EPIPEing a caller writing more than a pipe buffer. No endpoint is sourced and no transport
runs on refusal. Real `/bin/sh` tests cover all three consumers with isolated homes/endpoints and
fake curl; raw 2 MB stdin writes discriminate safe draining from an early exit.

Local desktop and Server Edition generators use their own `codexThreadIdentityRoot()`. The SSH
command constants deliberately omit a local record root. Client refresh is separate from daemon or
server lifecycle work: generated files can be overwritten at app boot or SSH reconnect, so a
client-only refresh must account for that reversion boundary until the durable bundle contains the
same source. Per-launch launchers are not part of this resolver change.

## Supply-chain guard

Account ids arrive from hand-editable `settings.json` / `project.json`. Every id passes
`ACCOUNT_ID_RE` (`^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*$`, must start alphanumeric) — via `accountScope()` in
the proxy, the launcher's own sh check, and the hook-server route — **before** it becomes a
directory scope, so `.`/`..`/leading-separator/`a/b`/absolute ids are refused at the door. The
launcher threads the account id through the `/codex-thread/{start,bind}` POST **body**, never on
argv (Constraint 6); a bad id falls back to plain `codex` rather than binding under a hostile scope,
and the server refuses it at `400` before the start handler can create an orphan thread.

## Spawn scope resolution (fail-closed)

`resolveCodexSessionScope(userDataDir, accountId, homeExists)` decides the `CODEX_HOME` +
`NODETERM_CODEX_ACCOUNT_ID` a Codex spawn runs under:

- **No id** → the system home. Always resolves, and it is written **explicitly** so it overwrites any
  managed scope inherited from a parent (tmux shares one server env) rather than silently acting as
  the wrong login.
- **An explicitly selected managed account whose home is missing** → **refuses**
  (`{ unavailable: 'codex-account' }`). It never falls back to the system home. This is deliberately
  **stricter** than the Claude sibling's first-spawn fallback: silently acting as the wrong login is a
  worse failure for an explicit switch than a refused spawn. The `pty-manager` maps `unavailable`
  straight through to the renderer.

The OAuth-shadowing env vars (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CODEX_API_KEY` — `AUTH_ENV_STRIP`) are removed from
the session env at spawn so a managed account always acts as its own `auth.json` login. That strip
touches only the **env**; no credential is ever placed on an argv (Constraint 6).

## The same-machine switch (three-phase, owner-authorized)

Moving a running node's conversation to another account **resumes the same conversation id, never
forks it**. The switch is a three-phase, TTL-bounded, owner-authorized protocol driven by the
renderer (`src/main/codex-accounts.ts`):

1. **plan** (`switch-thread`) — reserve both account ids (so a concurrent removal is blocked —
   Property 10), read the source rollout path off its app-server, and `planCodexRolloutExposure`
   (validate only, mutate nothing). Returns a `rollbackToken`.
2. **commit** (`commit-switch`) — `commitCodexRolloutExposure`: **atomically hardlink** the source
   rollout inode into the target account's `sessions/<same relative path>`. Same inode ⇒
   byte-identical conversation id. Only the **owning WebContents** may commit.
3. **finish** (`finish-switch`) — release the reservation. Refuses until commit actually ran, so a
   premature finish can never make the renderer recycle a node onto a target that has no rollout.

`rollback-switch`, the reservation TTL, and the owner being `destroyed` all release a reservation
without committing. The exposure is an **atomic, never-overwrite hardlink**: `link(2)` is
no-overwrite, an `EEXIST` collision is tolerated **only** when the existing target is already the same
inode (an idempotent re-expose), and the copy refuses to write **through** a symlinked directory
segment. The source `dev`/`ino` is re-verified before and after the link, so a mid-flight source swap
fails closed.

## The cross-machine transfer (local → SSH)

`transfer-thread-to-ssh` moves an **idle** local conversation to a remote account. The SOURCE leg
reuses `planCodexRolloutExposure`'s guards (regular file under `<home>/sessions/`, basename
`<threadId>.jsonl`, no symlinked segment) and then hands the upload + atomic remote install to the
SSH importer. Properties: the conversation id survives; the far side must **discover** the hardlinked
rollout before the node is recycled (verify-then-recycle — a false discovery is a **refused copy +
rollback**, never a silent one); the **local copy remains** (it is a hardlink, never moved); and an
existing remote rollout is **never overwritten** (`link` / `mv` fail closed on `EEXIST` / `exit 17`).
An absent importer (no live SSH manager) **fails closed** with a named error, never a silent success.

## Per-account usage (no mixing)

Usage is one **system row** plus one row **per managed account**, each keyed by its own `accountId`
and built independently — there is no reduce/merge step, so one account's numbers can never be
attributed to another. Every `fetchCodexUsage` return path (including `unavailable`) is stamped with
the account's identity, so an empty or failed read fails closed to **that** account, never to a
fabricated one; the system row stays explicitly un-owned (`accountId: undefined`). A throwing account
source yields **system-only**, never a made-up account. A cache fingerprint over the account set
busts stale numbers when an account is added, removed, or relabelled.

## Fail-closed properties (the house rules)

| Situation | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| Explicitly selected account, home missing | Refuse the spawn — no system fallback |
| Same thread id owned by two account scopes, no hint | No owner (proxy, sh resolver, relay catalog all fail closed) |
| Rollout collision at target, different inode | Never overwrite (throws / `exit 17`) |
| Cross-mount rollout link | Named `EXDEV` error — no silent byte-copy fallback (U3) |
| Far side cannot discover the imported rollout | Roll back the import |
| Record signed for account A, filed under B | MAC fails — rejected |
| No signing secret armed | Record write throws; nothing unsigned is written |
| Usage source throws | System-only; never a fabricated account |
| Account id from `settings.json` that could escape the root | Refused at the door by `isSafeAccountId` |

## U1 / U3 — the two constraints the probes settled

- **U3 — same filesystem.** A same-machine switch links a rollout inode between two LOCAL homes, both
  under `$HOME` (`~/.codex` and `~/.nodeterm/cx`), measured same-device on the build host (ext4).
  `link(2)` throws `EXDEV` across mounts, and a `$HOME` subtree **can** be bind-mounted onto another
  volume, so v1 does **not** silently fall back to a byte copy — `commit` surfaces a named `EXDEV`
  error. A cross-mount copy fallback is explicitly out of scope for S6 v1.
- **U1 — live discovery.** The cross-machine copy rests on a running `app-server` discovering a
  hardlinked rollout **without a reindex**. Mitigated in code by verify-then-recycle (a false U1 is a
  refused copy + rollback, never silent), but the live-daemon confirmation is a **device
  verification**, owed on a real host — see the acceptance gate.
