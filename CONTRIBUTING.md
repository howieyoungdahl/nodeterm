# Contributing to nodeterm

Thanks for looking. This file is the short door: enough to get running, plus the house rules that
actually get a pull request sent back. The long version — every subsystem and the reasoning behind
its invariants — lives in `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root, which is also loaded automatically if you
work with an AI coding agent.

nodeterm is licensed **BUSL-1.1** (converts to MIT after four years — see `LICENSE`). Contributions
are accepted under that license.

## Getting set up

```bash
npm install        # also patches + rebuilds node-pty against Electron's ABI (postinstall)
npm run dev        # dev mode with renderer HMR
npm run typecheck  # tsc for both the node and web projects — the fastest correctness gate
npm test           # vitest, unit + integration
```

`npm run server:dev` boots the Server Edition (browser UI) if you are working on that surface.

**If `src/main/node-pty-patch.test.ts` is red, your `node_modules` is unpatched — not your code.**
Run `npm run rebuild`. node-pty 1.1.0 leaks a pty device per spawn on macOS
([node-pty#950](https://github.com/microsoft/node-pty/issues/950)); we patch its source before
`electron-rebuild` compiles it, and that test guards the patch surviving upgrades.

## Where code goes

The repo is split by Electron process boundary and the split is enforced, not advisory:

| Directory | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `src/core/` | Electron-free service core. Talks to its shell only through `CorePlatform`. |
| `src/main/` | The Electron shell around `src/core` — windows, IPC, dialogs. |
| `src/server/` | The Server Edition shell (browser UI over WS-RPC). |
| `src/preload/` | The only bridge: `contextBridge` exposing `window.nodeTerminal`. |
| `src/renderer/` | React UI. Reaches main *only* through `window.nodeTerminal`. |
| `src/shared/` | Types and IPC channel names imported by all sides. |

`src/core/no-electron.test.ts` and `src/server/no-electron.test.ts` fail if `src/core` or
`src/server` import `electron` or `../main/*`.

**Put new service logic in `src/core` behind `CorePlatform`, not inline in `src/main`.** That is the
seam the Server Edition boots from; logic left in `src/main` silently does not exist there, and the
boundary tests cannot tell you a feature is *missing*.

## Three surfaces

A feature is not done until you have decided how it behaves on each — even if the decision is "not
applicable here":

1. **Desktop** (Electron)
2. **Server Edition** (Linux, browser)
3. **Mobile companion** — *nodeterm mobile*, a **private** repo (`nodeterm-ios`, SwiftUI). You
   cannot open a PR against it, so this is normally a follow-up note rather than same-PR
   work: say in your PR what the mobile side would need, and **mention @eneskirca** so it
   gets picked up there. "Not applicable" is a fine answer — just make it a stated one.

Anything reachable from `window.nodeTerminal` needs a **real** implementation in
`src/renderer/bridge/`, or a deliberate, documented degrade. The `satisfies NodeTerminalApi` gate
forces you to *declare* every member, but a no-op stub compiles fine while doing nothing.

The **canvas and the kanban board are two views of the same nodes.** When you add something to a
canvas node — a header action, a badge, a menu item — ask whether the board's card and card modal
need it too, and wire it in the same change.

A board card's **source** is a registry entry, not a branch you add at a call site
(`renderer/lib/kanbanSources.ts`). Declare the source once — filter label, `placement`
(`assignment` = the board's own persisted assignments, `provider` = the provider owns the column),
in-column `lane` order, whether it is `configured` for a board — and give it its one leaf (a card
component and the list path feeding it). Columns take lanes and name no source; the drag path
branches on `placement`. If you find yourself writing `=== 'github'` outside the registry, the
registry is missing a field.

## House rules

- **Anything path-shaped: Windows is a delivery target.** Most of this was written on
  macOS/Linux, so the recurring defect is code that is genuinely correct on POSIX —
  `split('/')`, `startsWith('/')` as an is-absolute test, a bare `fs.rename`. Use
  `path.basename`/`join`/`sep`, publish files with `renameAtomic`, and write at least one test with
  a real `C:\`-shaped input. Guards enforce some of this and will fail your PR. In the Server
  Edition and relay tabs, the browser's OS is NOT the filesystem's OS: obtain the dialect from the
  core that owns the files, and keep an unobserved host unknown rather than guessing. Conversely,
  on POSIX a backslash is legal filename text — do not treat both separators as interchangeable
  unless the owning filesystem is known to be Windows.

- **Never publish a file with a bare `fs.rename`.** Use `renameAtomic` or `writeFileAtomic` from
  `src/core/fs-atomic.ts`. On Windows a rename fails with `EPERM` whenever anything has the
  destination open — Defender scanning the file you just wrote, the search indexer, OneDrive — so
  the plain version loses saves intermittently and only on other people's machines. A test scans
  for this and will fail your PR; `docs/atomic-writes.md` explains why the retry is safe. Every
  temp/part staging name must also be unique per call across processes and cleaned by its owner —
  including paths embedded in generated SSH commands or handed to scp, which the `fs` scan cannot
  see. Keep a remote temp's own leaf bounded: extending an already-valid maximum-length target leaf
  with a UUID suffix turns an atomic write into a guaranteed `ENAMETOOLONG` failure.

- **Never write to a child's stdin without an `'error'` listener on that stream.** A pipe write's
  failure is not a throw at the call site: when the child exits before draining stdin (a CLI handed
  a flag it doesn't know, an unreachable ssh host), Node re-emits the EPIPE as an async `'error'`
  EVENT on the stream — a try/catch around the write is inert, and the unhandled event crashes the
  whole main process with an "Uncaught Exception: write EPIPE" dialog (issue #382's class). Attach
  `child.stdin.on('error', ...)` before the first write — log via `console.warn` so the debug ring
  sees it, or settle the pending call; the child's exit code stays the authority on the outcome
  (see `tmux-control-client.ts` and `pty-manager.ts` `runWithStdin` for the house pattern). A test
  (`src/core/stream-epipe.guard.test.ts`) scans for this and will fail your PR.

- **Never unmount, move or re-key a browser/web node's element.** An Electron `<webview>`'s guest
  process dies on DOM detach — and a detach includes any `insertBefore`/`appendChild` MOVE of an
  attached element, which React performs whenever a kept child's relative order among kept keyed
  children changes. That is why webview-hosting nodes render in one stable pool region at the tail
  of the `<ReactFlow>` nodes prop (`renderer/lib/webviewKeepAlive.ts` — read its header before
  touching the merge, the node array swap in Canvas's load effect, or anything that reorders
  nodes), and why a background project's pages stay mounted as hidden ghosts instead of
  unmounting. `display:none` is safe (measured: state, scroll and viewport size survive); a reorder
  or unmount reloads the user's page and loses their in-page state.

These are the ones that come up in review most often. Each exists because its absence caused a real
bug.

**A failed read is never evidence of absence.** "Could not measure" and "there is nothing" are
different facts and must stay distinguishable at every layer. Collapsing them is how a panel ends up
reporting "no sessions" on a host running thirty.

**Degrade to nothing, never to something wrong.** A probe that fails means the bare, safe command —
never a substituted nearest match. A hand-editable value that is unrecognised must yield the safe
default, never something more destructive than the default.

**A Server Edition agent owns only nodes it freshly opened in this server run.** The
creator ledger is process-local and must never be rebuilt from `.nodeterm/project.json`, titles,
hook history, or a surviving tmux name: all are writable or stale. A restart therefore clears
ownership, performs no node/session adoption, and leaves durable queued launches dormant. Metadata
mutations and message delivery validate every target before writing anything; missing proof is a
named refusal. There is no agent ownership exception for global dead-card cleanup. The separately
authenticated operator API and its periodic reaper share one engine; it skips SSH projects and
removes a local terminal card only after two definitive absent-session probes. Failed or unreadable
probes preserve it. Validate Server upgrades against a disposable data directory and port.
Restarting a shared live service is an explicit operator action, never a test or an automatic
repair step.

**The Server operator API is a different principal, not an agent escape hatch.** `/opsapi/*` is
TCP-loopback-only and authenticates only the `0600` `ops-token` bearer; browser cookies, the
operator password, proxy headers, and node tokens never substitute for it. Keep agent
canvas-control creator ownership strict. A dead-card sweep requires two definitive absent-pane
probes, preserves `unknown` on every read failure, and shares one mutation engine with the periodic
reaper. Server-owned operator and agent workspace transactions also share one FIFO; separate
load/save queues can overwrite each other with stale snapshots. `/opsapi/health` must snapshot
spawn-handler state without awaiting the preparation or parallel external launches it diagnoses;
timed-out non-cancellable launches remain visible until they actually settle. Credentials still
never ride argv — operator clients feed curl headers via stdin or another non-argv channel.

**A Server Edition message is not submitted just because tmux accepted Enter.** A fresh agent
composer can render a pasted envelope before it is ready to consume the submit key. Capture the
composed pane after Enter; if it did not advance, send one bounded retry and capture again. The
target's verified next-turn hook remains the delivery receipt. Never report the paste as delivered
from a successful tmux command alone, and never loop Enter against somebody else's composer.

**A plain terminal is not a Claude node.** It may carry the generic node/endpoint wiring needed for
a hand-launched agent to report hooks, but it gets no `NODETERM_AGENT_ID` and no
`NODETERM_CANVAS_CONTROL` until the serialized node explicitly names an agent.

**Re-validate hand-editable values at the point of use**, not by their TypeScript type. Settings
come from git-shared JSON and can end up interpolated into a shell command line.

**Test generated shell for real.** If you generate a shell command, run it under an actual
`/bin/sh` against a fixture tree. A composed fixture will not tell you that `echo ##MEM` prints an
empty line because `#` starts a comment.

**A shared agent daemon is live-session infrastructure.** Codex's app-server control socket is
shared by every `--remote` TUI in an account scope, so stopping or replacing one daemon disconnects
every attached canvas node. A managed launcher must keep the already-bound thread under a bounded
supervisor: resume only when protocol health failed or the known socket generation changed, never
loop an unrelated client error, and never replay the original prompt after reconnect. Probe a
responsive daemon before invoking lifecycle repair; stale PID bookkeeping is not permission to kill
working sessions. See `docs/shared-codex-node-identity.md`.

**Credentials never ride argv — local or SSH.** Not a tmux `-e` pair, not `curl -H`, not a remote
command string. `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is mode 444 on a stock Linux, and a remote command line is argv
on the host too: we shipped the hook bearer that way and any other account on the machine could read
it and open a terminal running an arbitrary command. Pass secrets by 0600 file or by **stdin**
(`curl --config -`), and never add an argv fallback. See `docs/node-identity.md`.

**Both raw listeners change together** — `src/main/index.ts` and `src/server/agent-status.ts`. A new
field on a hook event that reaches only the desktop leaves the Server Edition quietly without the
feature, and the boundary tests can only tell you an import is wrong, never that a field is missing.
The same applies to any hook-server signature change; this repo has shipped one to a single shell
three times.

**Do not take scrolling away from tmux.** It owns the mouse, the scrollback and the alternate
screen. A previous design moved that into the emulator and failed structurally; `CLAUDE.md` explains
why in detail.

**A spawn-env write does not reach a tmux session on its own.** The shared tmux server takes each
new session's env from its own GLOBAL env (inherited from whichever client *started* the server) —
the creating client's process env only matters for names listed in `update-environment` (or passed
as non-secret `-e` pairs). Setting `env.FOO` in `pty-manager` therefore works for the plain-shell
fallback and for the one client that happens to start the server, and silently does nothing (or
worse, leaks the server-starter's value into everyone else) after that. That is how issue #419
shipped: managed-account `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` leaked into system-account sessions. New per-session
env either joins `ACCOUNT_SCOPE_UPDATE_ENV` / the gateway list, or rides `-e` — and gets a
real-tmux test (`account-env.realtmux.test.ts` is the pattern).

**Do not hold a workspace transaction lock across PTY or subprocess work.** Save and publish the
durable node while serialized, release the lock, then start external work behind a bounded deadline.
PTY creation is not cancellable: a timeout must preserve the card, report that the operation may
finish late, and tell the caller not to repeat. Any capability promise used on this path needs its
own bounded fail-safe; an edition-specific `false` answer must not be replaced with a getter whose
initializer that edition never runs. When close can race the unlocked external phase, retain a
per-node cancellation until the late operation settles and destroy its exact backend again; the
first destroy may have run before anything existed.

**A new keyboard chord has to survive the shells, not just the renderer.** The application menu is
ours (`buildAppMenu` in `main/index.ts`), but its command-style accelerators — ⌘Q, ⌘M, ⌘W, ⌘0, ⌘⇧B,
⌘, — are still handled above the page, so your `keydown` branch simply never runs: steal the chord
back in `main/keydown-intercept.ts`'s `before-input-event` allowlist and forward it, like the three
already there. Two legs stand the menu down instead of stealing — the terminal-first policy and an
armed shortcut recorder (`menuStandsDown` → `menuItemIdsToSuspend`, since a disabled item suppresses
its accelerator) — and Reload (⌘R / ⌘⇧R) is the named exception that always stays with the app,
because it is the crash-recovery lever. Browsers own a different set. And any chord that reaches the canvas needs the two refusals every canvas shortcut
here has: not while the kanban board covers it, not while the user is typing.

**Comments explain WHY, and name the failure they prevent.** The codebase is deliberately dense with
reasoning. A comment that restates the code is noise; one that says "do not simplify this back,
here is what broke" is the point.

**A generated sh client reads its node token through the one resolver.** Every POSIX-sh client we
emit (the managed hook script, `nodeterm.sh`, `context.sh`) presents this node's per-node identity by
calling `nt_read_node_token` from `core/agents/node-token-sh.ts` — never by re-typing
`head -n 1 "$NODETERM_NODE_TOKEN_DIR/$NODETERM_NODE_ID"`. That copy was issue #384: a session is
pinned for life to the endpoint FILE path it got at tmux creation, so a client that trusts only what
that file advertises presents nothing forever when the file is old or unreadable — and because the
hook script alone could heal itself, the same node proved itself through one client and was refused
through another for the life of the session.

**Local generated sh clients recover shared-Codex identity before their env gate.** A Codex tool
shell is forked by the account-scoped app-server, so it has `CODEX_THREAD_ID` but not the pane's
`NODETERM_*`. Managed hooks, local `nodeterm.sh`, and local `context.sh` must prepend
`codexThreadIdentityResolverSh(codexThreadIdentityRoot())` before checking `NODETERM_NODE_ID` or
`NODETERM_CANVAS_CONTROL`. Keep the SSH shim constants machine-neutral: baking the desktop/server
record path into a remote host is both wrong and a local-layout leak.

**A stream error is not a throw you can catch.** When a write to `process.stdout`/`stderr` fails —
`EPIPE` down a closed pipe, `EIO` after macOS revokes a closed terminal's tty — node reports it by
emitting `'error'` on the stream a tick later, and the default for an unhandled `'error'` event is
to kill the process. The stack it carries was captured at the write, so the crash *reads* as if it
happened synchronously at your `console.log`, and wrapping that call in `try/catch` changes nothing
(measured on node 22). If you write to a stream that can go away, attach an `'error'` listener and
latch the writer off — `installLogSink` (`src/core/log-sink.ts`) is the worked example. Issue #382.

**Agent features attach to base harness capabilities, not frontend allowlists.** A custom agent can
inherit a builtin harness, so add the capability and its one shared leaf (`src/shared/agents`) and
let every UI ask the helper. Repeating Claude/Codex/etc. cases in menus breaks that inheritance and
eventually drifts.

## Testing

`npm test` must pass, and `npm run typecheck` is the fastest gate.

Beyond that, one habit is worth more than any other here:

**Mutation-test your guards.** Delete or invert the check you just added and confirm a test *fails*.
A green suite is not evidence on its own — during one recent feature this caught nine tests that
passed with the code they were meant to pin removed, including one mutation that survived the entire
4,500-test suite because the class it touched had no test file at all.

Watch for fixtures that cannot discriminate: if every row in your fixture happens to make the
mutant's output identical to the real one, the test proves nothing while looking thorough.

**Never pin behaviour by reading source text.** `expect(SRC).toContain('...')` is the fixture that
can never discriminate: it is satisfied by code that is present *and wrong*. We shipped one —
`src/main/menu-accelerator-intercepts.test.ts` matched three strings inside the `before-input-event`
handler, and stayed green on a tree where a shared guard had moved out from under them and the bare
`0` key was swallowed app-wide. It was, precisely, red on the fix and green on the break. If a
module is untestable because it imports `electron` at the top, that is the thing to fix: lift the
decision into a pure function next to it (`keydown-intercept.ts`, `main-window.ts`,
`zoomShortcut.ts`) and press the keys.

Where a behaviour can only be verified on hardware we do not have in CI (a Mac, a real SSH host, a
GPU), say so explicitly rather than implying coverage. Several docs carry numbered device
checklists for exactly this.

## Pull requests

- Branch from `main`. CI runs `quality`, `CodeQL` and `Dependency review`; all three are required.
- Explain **why**, not just what. If a decision has a trade-off, name it and say what you rejected.
- If you measured something, put the numbers in — they save the next person the same afternoon.
- Say what you did **not** verify. That is more useful than a confident summary.

## Documentation

Two files, two audiences:

- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** (this file) — what another human needs before touching the code.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — the deep invariants, per subsystem, with the reasoning and the measurements.

**If you change or discover something other contributors must know, update this file too.** An
invariant that only lives in a commit message is one refactor away from being violated by someone
who never saw it.
